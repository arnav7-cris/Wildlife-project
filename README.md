# Wildlife-project
Your project **“Wildlife Sighting Management System”** is a database-driven application that helps track and manage wildlife sightings across different locations. It allows users to record sightings, view species data, and automatically generate alerts for endangered species using triggers, all through a simple and interactive Streamlit dashboard.
